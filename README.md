# Using-Python-For-Research-HarvardX-PH526x

I was new to Jupyter Notebook.  It works well for Coding with Python3.  I enjoyed this class and learned more about formulas and how nicely “Using Python for Research” was 
designed for research with Jupyter Notebook! 

I learned the basics of python3, which was helpful to refresh my memory on what I learned in March 2020.  Python libraries and concepts that I used in research for the second 
week of learning.  Such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Randomness, and Time.  Then I began Case studies; the first one was on ‘DNA translation.’  The second case study was on Language 
processing.  The third case study was Intro to Classification.  The fourth and fifth case studies involved reading your data with a CSV file.  The sixth case study was ‘Social 
Network Analysis.’  The final case studies involved linear regression, logistic regression, and random forest.

I thought this class was great for those looking to become more familiar with Python3!
